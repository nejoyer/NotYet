I created an Android App for tracking habits. This is the code for that app.

I've uploaded it to github because I want it saved somewhere other than locally, and also so it is available as a code sample. It is mostly intended for my own personal purposes, but feel free to look at the coding techniques that I've employed. That said, no warranty expressed or implied. If you see something that you think could be improved, or you are wondering why I did something a certain way, feel free to message me.

The app is published in the Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outlook.notyetapp

I intentionally don't include instructions for how to build/run this project yourself, since that is not the intention. Some files necessary for the app to work have been redacted because they contain sensitive strings.
