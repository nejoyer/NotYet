            <h3>The Recommended Way To Use This App</h3>

                <li>Don\'t create too many activities at once.</li>

                <li>Record your data. Even bad data. Always.</li>
                <li>Use this app *every* day.</li>
                <li>If the main habit you are trying to improve on doesn\'t need to be every day, pick a second one that does need to be done every day. Getting in the habit of using this app will hlep you build other, more important habits.</li>

            <h3>FAQ:</h3>
            <ul class="faq">
                <li>What do A7, A30, and A90 mean?</li>
                <p>A7 is the average of the last 7 days including today.</p>
                <p>A30 is the average of the last 30 days including today.</p>
                <p>A90 is the average of the last 90 days including today.</p>
                <li>Do I have to go into the habit to set today\'s value?</li>
                <p>No, you can specify a value in the settings to be the "Swipe Left" value. Then if you swipe left from the main page, that value will be set as the value for today and then the activity will be hidden from the list</p>
                <li>What if I don\'t want to do an activity today, can I hide it from the list?</li>
                <p>Yes, just swipe it to the right to hide it for today</p>
                <li>How can I see activities that I\'ve already hidden for today?</li>
                <p>Tap the eye icon at the top of the screen to toggle whether or not ALL activities should be shown.</p>
                <li>Can I update multiple values at once?</li>
                <p>Yes, when looking at the page with the graph and all the dates, swipe right on a date to select it. Swipe right on more dates to select them. Enter the new value in the resulting popup.</p>
                <li>How can I request a new feature?</li>
                <p>Feel free to email me using the link at the top. No promises.</p>
                <li>Are there any other features that I might not know about?</li>
		<p>Tap a label in the Legend on the graph to toggle it being hidden.</p>
                <li>Why is it called NotYet?</li>
                <p>In reference to the fact that none of us (including this app) are perfect. We can only continue to strive to get better.</p>
                <li>Do you make any money off this app?</li>
                <p>Right now it is a labor of love. I reserve the rights to try to monitize it later.</p>
                <li>What habits are you trying to form?</li>
                <p>So you want me to publish a list of the things that I don\'t like about myself?</p>
                <li>I really like the app, how can I help?</li>
                <p>Keep using the app. Send me an email to let me know you are enjoying it. Feel free to send feedback as well. Share the app with your friends. Give me a good rating/review in the app store.</p>
                <li>What features are you thinking about adding?</li>
                <p>Backup of your data to Google Drive. Adding up/down arrows on the main page so that you can increment/decrement today\'s value.</p>
